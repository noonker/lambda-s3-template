#+TITLE: lambda-s3-template

* Description

This repository sets up AWS infrastructure to run a Lambda on S3 put events. To change how the lambda operates simply modify the code in =lambda/main.py=. There should be enough of a skeleton in that file to:
 - Read a file from the =sourceBucket=
 - Modify / action on a file in a bucket
 - Upload the artifacts to a =resultsBucket= S3 bucket

To deploy this code ensure that the [[https://aws.amazon.com/cli/][AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)]] is installed and run the following after pulling the repository
#+begin_src shell
cd lambda-s3-template
cdk init # Sets up the environment to deploy this CDK stack
cdk deploy # Deployes all the assets
#+end_src
